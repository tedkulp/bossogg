Boss Ogg -- A Music Server

This is a quick README designed to help you get bossogg compiled and running.

Please use the forums at http://bossogg.wishy.org or drop by #bossogg on
irc.oftc.net for further help and to address issues not covered here.

- Requirements

In order to compile boss3, here is a list of what you will need:

	- gcc/g++ 3.0 or greater
	- Python 2.2 (http://python.org)
	- Sqlite 2.8.3 (http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite)
	- Pysqlite 0.4.3 (http://pysqlite.sourceforge.net)
	- libao 0.8.3 (http://www.xiph.org)

These libs are optional and are only required for certain types of media.  You
should have at least one of these, or else it's not going to be very useful:

	- libvorbis/libvorbisfile 1.0 (for Ogg Vorbis support)
	  (http://www.vorbis.com)
	- libflac 1.1.0 (for Flac support) (http://flac.sourceforge.net)
	- libmad 0.15 (for MP3 support) (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad)
	- libid3 3.8.3 (for id3/mp3 metadata support)
	  (http://id3lib.sourceforge.net)

To compile the optional ripper, you will also need:

	- libcddb 0.9.4 (http://libcddb.sourceforge.net)
	- libcdparanoia 3.9.8 (http://www.xiph.org/paranoia)

You will need the development versions of these packages if compiling you are
compiling it yourself.

You can checkout out the latest deveopment version with subversion (it's like
CVS but better): svn co http://svn.wishy.org/svn/repos/boss3.  In order to
compile it, you will also need the following:

	- swig 1.3.16+ (http://www.swig.org)
	- subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org)

- Compilation

Compilation and installion are very typical for unix applications.
'./configure' to configure the program to your system ('./configure --help'
will show you some flags). 'make' will build the python modules.  'make install'
will install the program.

- Running

Start the server with 'bossogg'. There is an import script called
bosync to import songs (run with --help for some help with that).  Importing
must be done while the bossogg daemon is running.

There is also boshell, which is an included utility for sending simple commands
to a running boss server.  It does not include a full command set, but it is
very useful for running simple commands and great for testing configurations.
Check it out.

- Configuration

The configuration file is now generated dynamically. If you run bossogg as a
user (recommended), the settings will be stored in ~/.bossogg. The db is
bossogg.db and the configuration file is bossogg.conf.  bossogg.conf has some
basic settings that can be tweaked before the server is started.  Most of these
can be changed on the fly as well.  Try not to edit this file if the server is
running, because the config and what bossogg thinks is in the config file might
become two different things.

Please see the INSTALL document for more information.
