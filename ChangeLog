-- Version 0.13.4-rc5 - 13 Feb 2004 --
* Import is once again inside one transaction.  This will help the
  sync performance and also make cancelling mid-sync actually rollback
  and not keep what has been imported so far.

-- Version 0.13.4-rc4 - 12 Feb 2004 --
* Fixed some error messages in bosync.  It seems to be working pretty well
  now.

-- Version 0.13.4-rc3 - 09 Feb 2004 --
* Fixed a bug where boss would seg if it couldn't get access to the audio
  device.  It should shutdown gracefully.
* Some typos and leftover boimport references have been squashed.

-- Version 0.13.4-rc2 - 08 Feb 2004 --
* Added the -u, --user to drop to a different user for actually running
  boss
* Removed the bossogg.log handler from bosslog.  This needs to be worked
  out better and causes a lot of problems when running as a different user.

-- Version 0.13.4rc1 - 06 Feb 2004 --
* Gave the Makefiles some love so that all headers are included in a "make
  dist"
* Fixed the "doesn't let go of the port right away" bug.
* Added genre support on the server side.
* Rewrote the logging system. It now supports the concept of channels, so 
  you can look at certain debug messages etc. It's based on the logging 
  module for 2.3 but works with 2.2. See boss3/util/bosslog.py for details 
  on how to use it.
* The cursor for the sqlite module has been replaced with one that inherits 
  the original but does checking of exceptions caused by the sql call, it
  also automagicly locks out any other threads from writing to the database
  at the same time. The self.lock.* wrappers around cursor.execute() are not
  required now
* Added bosync which is ment as a replacement for boimport. It's still 
  missing some features but it is fucntional and can import/sync collections.
* Totally rewrote the loop in Player.py.  NEXT and JUMP states are no longer
  used.
* Apply af_'s shout fixes
* Made the Queue more modular, which should make it easier to add new queue or
  end-of-queue types in the future.  The random queue now preshuffles so we
  shouldn't get repeated songs.
* Fixed the case sensitivity for artist and albums lists (ex. REM comes
  after Rage Against the Machine now)
* Updated the database schema to version 3 which adds an index to make
  metaartist lookups MUCH faster
* Implemented a different way of getting header stuff from some ID3V1 mp3
  tags
* Added new modules bossxmlrpclib and bossxmlrpcserver which are used 
  to modify the standard modules xmlrpclib and SimpleXMLRPCServer so 
  that in future if they need to be updated, they can be.
* Added threaded server support to the XMLRPC Server. BossOgg can now
  handle multiple queries at once. Some db intensive queries may still
  cause it to block other queries.
* Added support to gzip the xml payload of the http request if the 
  client supports it. (If client sends "Accept-Encoding: gzip" header,
  the server will respond with "Content-Encoding: gzip" header and gzip
  the xml body)
* Added support for py-xmlrpc module. If this module is installed, xml
  parsing/dumping speed will be increased by about 5 times, it will also
  use significantly less cpu in doing so too.
* Fixed some typos in boimport to do with help and the printing of #
* Fixed a bug in boimport that would cause files to inherit values from the
  previous song that did have the value. (eg metaartist would flow thru to
  every file until a new metartist was found)

	
-- Version 0.13.3 - 08 Oct 2003 --
* Include pthread.h in bossao.h
* Fix MP3 crash bug if file doesn't exist
* Fixed another bug in the stop and play sequence (BrianHV)
* Fixed a bug in playindex
* Added info("endofqueue") command
* Hitting stop and then play again while in endofqueue will start
the same song over again instead of going to the next one
* Some autotools work to fix libshout2 checking and also remove a
lot of the -DHAVE_* lines from the configure script
* Added the "stop" and "repeat" endofqueue functions

work right (Thanks BrianHV!)
* Fixed a nasty seg bug in bossao
* Changed the logic so that an album name can be used for multiple
artists
* Added a version number to the config file.  NOTE!!!  Auto-updating
of config files do not work at this point.  The file will be wiped and
recreated.  This should be the only time, however, that it needs to be
done.

* Fixed FLAC bug where current time wasn't getting reset
* Fixed configure script to do libshout stuff semi-properly
* Fixed track number metadata while importing

the db
* Implemented byte swapping for FLAC on big endian architectures
* Always open ao device in little endian mode
* Check the length of vorbis/FLAC comments properly
* Made ogg/flac tag headers (ARTIST=) case insensitive, because XMMS
apparently makes them the non-standard ALL CAPS
* Changed README to say that gcc/g++ 3 or greater is required
