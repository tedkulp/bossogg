Boss Ogg INSTALL Docs

--------------------------

Install of boss is a pretty simple affair these days.  One of the main goals
of the rewrite was to make the install process much more simple.  All of the
database and configuration file creation and administration is done pretty
much behind the schenes.

This document assumes that you will be using a source distribution of bossogg,
so we'll quickly go though to steps to compile, install, and (hopefully) get
boss playing for you.

Download the tar.gz file and put it into a directory that you have access
to.

* untar zxvf bossogg-0.xx.tar.gz
* cd bossogg-0.xx
* ./configure

The configure script will figure out what dependencies are installed.  You
can use ./configure --help to see some options, though these are mostly for
disabling options that you might not necessarily want.

* make

This will build the python modules.  If all goes well, it will take a minute
or two and then return to the prompt without any errors.

Now, you have two options.  You can run bossogg from the source directory if
you don't have root priviledges.  However, if you do want to install it for
system-wide use, do a

* make install

Boss is ready to go now.  You can start it with

* bossogg (or ./bossogg if running from the source dir)

You can also use the --help option to see what else it can do.  --detach is
good for running it as a daemon.  --verbose is great for debugging.

Now, it's time to import your songs.  This is probaby the trickiest part of
the install process.  Because of the advanced type of metadata useage
involved, import isn't an exact science.

* bosync --help (./bosync --help)

Because of the way importing works, the bossogg server needs to be running
when bosync is run.  Bosync works in one of two ways.  If your collection
is pretty well organized, you can use a prototype for importing.  For example,
-F "/home/wishy/music/%artist%/%album% - %song%/%track% - %song%.%ext%" works
very well for me.  However, most people have their music organized by the
metadata tags.  If no format is given, as much information as possible will
be grabbed from the tags themselves and used.  If you are having problems,
use the -v option to see why it is not importing.  If we're missing a good
way to import music, please give us some feedback.

After the import is complete, it should start playing music.

Good luck, and let us know how it went.
